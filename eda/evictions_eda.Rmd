## Section 1

From here, we can see that Elgin, Powdersville, and Springdale appeared in the data more than once. To get an accurate city count, 


```{r}
summary(cities)

cities %>% 
  count(name) %>% 
  count(n) 

cities %>% 
  count(name) %>% 
  filter(n > 1)

cities %>% 
  arrange(desc(evictions))

```
